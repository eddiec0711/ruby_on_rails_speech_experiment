#### Task types
##### <a name="question_page"></a> Question page
A question page simply creates a form for the participant to fill in. It is useful for collecting data such as personal information.

The following shows a question page from the point of view of the participant:
![Example question page](/images/example_questions.png)

* To add a question, click the relevant "Add question" button from the task page.  
  ![Add question buttons](/images/add_question_buttons.png)
* To change the prompt for a question, edit the prompt in the text field and click ![Change](/images/change_button.png).  
  ![Question prompt](/images/question_prompt.png)

###### Question types
There are 3 question types:

* **Text question**
  * A simple text field
* **Option question**
  * Dropdown box, Radio buttons (select one) or Checkboxes (select many).
  * To add an option, fill the text field in the options column with the option text and press add.  
    ![Add options](/images/add_options.png)
* **Rating Scale**
  * A numerical scale for a participant to rate something.
  * To change the scale text, change the "From" (Lowest) and "To" (Highest) fields in the options column and press "Change".
  * To change the number of options available to the participant, change the "Number of options" field in the options column and press "Change".  
    ![Change scale](/images/change_scale.png)

##### Audio sample
An Audio sample allows a participant to listen to, answer questions about, and react in real time to a provided audio sample.  

* To upload an audio file click browse, select the file on your device, and click "Upload audio".  
  ![Upload audio](/images/add_audio_file.png)
* To upload a transcript file click browse, select the file on your device, and click "Upload transcript".  
  ![Upload transcript](/images/add_transcript_file.png)
  * Transcript files must be in ELAN .eaf format.

###### Sample tasks

An audio sample can have tasks added to allow the participant to interact with the sample. The task types are as follows:  
  ![Audio task buttons](/images/add_audio_task_buttons.png)

* **Audio hearing**
  * An opportunity for the participant to listen to the audio sample.
* **Question page**
  * A page of questions about the sample. This task is set up in the same manner as an [experiment question page](#question_page).
* **Reaction task**
  * An opportunity for the participant to listen to the audio sample and click a button when they react to the provided prompt. After the sample is finished the participant is shown each clicked section and asked to justify their reaction.
  * To change the reaction prompt, click the reaction task on the sample task page, fill in the text field with the new reaction prompt and click "Change reaction prompt".  
  ![Change reaction prompt](/images/change_reaction.png)

  ![Example reaction task](/images/example_click_task.png)  

* It may be useful to include an easy calibration reaction task to measure response times of a participant and aid analysis of other reaction tasks. Clicking the ![This is a calibration task](/images/calibration.png) checkbox marks a sample as a calibration sample and disables click justification for reaction tasks.

#### <a name="publishing"> Publishing an experiment
To allow people to participate in an experiment it must first be published. An experiment can only be edited **before** being published and can only be completed by a participant **after** being published.  

**Publishing is irreversible. Once an expeiment has been published it cannot be edited**

To publish an experiment click ![Publish](/images/publish_button.png) on the experiment page and select "OK" on the confirmation popup.  
  ![Confirm publish](/images/publish_confirm.png)  

###### Publishing errors  
You may encounter warnings or errors when attempting to publish an experiment.  
  ![Publish errors](/images/publish_errors.png)  

  Errors appear when something major is wrong with your experiment, e.g. There is a listening task but you have not yet uploaded an audio file.  
  Warnings appear when something minor is wrong with your experiment, e.g. A question exists with the default name (New text question).  
  You must fix any errors before publishing an experiment, but warnings can be overridden with the ![publish_anyway](/images/publish_anyway.png) button.

#### <a name="exp_researcher_3"> Results
Once an experiment has been published results are available for download at any time.  
From an experiment page, basic completion statistics can be viewed for the current experiment.  
![Experiment stats](/images/experiment_stats.png)  
Current results for the experiment can be downloaded in Excel .xlsx format with the ![Download results](/images/download_results.png) button.  
The resulting document contains a sheet of responses for each question task and a sheet of click justifications for each reaction task.
